The solution is to ensure that the class `bg-red-500` is not purged. This can be done by explicitly including it in the content array of your `tailwind.config.js` file or by adding it to your purge options. By adding it to your content array, the purge step knows this class should not be removed.  Here's how the corrected file would look:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-red-500 p-4">
      This should now work!
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
