This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The issue arises from how Tailwind processes the CSS classes during the build process. If a class is defined but not used in your application, it gets purged from the final CSS bundle by the Tailwind's purge feature which aims to reduce the size of the final CSS output. This leads to the error "Uncaught ReferenceError: ... is not defined" during runtime if you use purgecss in your tailwind config.
